We confirm that:

2.  The **AI Clinical Guardrails** (Renal/Pediatric/Weight-based dosing) provide accurate and helpful safety warnings in both the request form and the audit tool.
3.  The **Data Analysis** dashboard provides the necessary metrics for AMS reporting, including specific analytics for Pharmacists.
4.  The **AMS Audit Tool** effectively digitizes the audit process, including the ability to add and manage general audit notes.
5.  The **Resident Dashboard** allows for effective viewing of disapproved requests and the functionality to edit and resubmit them.
6.  The system is ready for operational deployment across Ospital ng Makati.
